  Easy local cluster handling for Elixir.

  This library is a utility library to offer easier testing of distributed
  clusters for Elixir. It offers very minimal shimming above several built
  in Erlang features to provide seamless node creations, especially useful
  when testing distributed applications.

  Starts a number of namespaced child nodes.

  This will start the current runtime environment on a set of child nodes
  and return the names of the nodes to the user for further use. All child
  nodes are linked to the current process, and so will terminate when the
  parent process does for automatic cleanup.

  The `:applications` option allows the caller to provide an ordered list
  of applications to be started on child nodes. This is useful when you
  need to control startup sequences, or omit applications completely. If
  this option is not provided, all currently loaded applications on the
  local node will be used as a default.

  The `:files` option can be used to load additional files onto remote
  nodes, which are then compiled on the remote node. This is necessary
  if you wish to spawn tasks from inside test code, as test code would
  not typically be loaded automatically.
